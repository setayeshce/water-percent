Remember to replace `^latest_version` with the current version of `WaterPercent`.

## Usage üõ†

Here's a quick example to get you started with `WaterPercent`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:waterpercent/waterpercent.dart';

class MyWaterWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return WaterWave(
      size: 150,
      percent: 0.75,
      color: Colors.blueAccent,
      percentStyle: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 20,
        fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
        color: Colors.white,
      ),

This snippet creates a `WaterWave` widget displaying a 75% filled water wave animation.
